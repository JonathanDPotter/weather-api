# Weather-Imp

I made this app to practice consuming a third-party api. This is the front-end. There is also a back-end express app that handles the api calls. The back-end repo is [here](https://github.com/JonathanDPotter/weather-api-back), and this app is hosted on vercel [here](https://weather-l95e66yd3-jonathandpotter.vercel.app/).

## Technologies Used

The app is written in typescript with react. It uses react router, redux, axios and sass for styling.

## Functionality

On the home page a user can choose to use their device location or enter a US zip code. The home page displays the current weather conditions for that location. A user can navigate to the three-day forecast or hourly forecast pages to get those forecasts as well.
